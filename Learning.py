# In order to understand how to do something you need to practice

# To practice I am going to write a small program

# This block of code below starts with def
# The function is called mynumber
# It is followed by a pararentheses and inside the pararenthisis is a paramter
# The code is followed by a colon
# Once you press return it indents it
# return is a keyword

def mynumber(num):
    return num


print("Hell World the number in my number is:")
print(mynumber(17))

# To run another code you can do many things

# The output willm return the number and add 1


def runnum(num):
    return num + 1


print('The return number is:')
# Youd o not need exclamation marks as you are printing the functions
print(runnum(5))


#I am going to return a number and add 2
def my_num(num):
    return num + 2

print('The new number is:')
print (my_num(9))
